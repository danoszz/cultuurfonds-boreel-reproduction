description: >-
  Jacques-Henri Alberti is born in Bärenthal, by Niederbronn in 1730. He
  realised an apprenticeship by the well-known Jean-Louis Imlin II from 1756 to
  1764 and became a master in 1764. He got married to the niece of his master,
  Catherine-Salomé Emmerich, in 1765. In 1768, Alberti had worked together with
  Jean Louis Imlin for the execution of the table service of Elisabeth Auguste
  of the Palatinate-Sulzbach (1721-1794). He had taken over during 1768-1781 the
  direction of Imlin’s workshop after the death of the later.


  Jacques-Henri Alberti was together with Imlin, Kirstein and Oertel among the
  most important representatives of the vermeil of Strasbourg – i.d. of
  silver-gilt objects. Many objects from Alberti’s hands are hold at museums of
  decorative arts in Strasbourg, Colmar, Paris and the Kurpfälzisches Museum in
  Heidelberg as well as in private collections.
